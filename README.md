<h1>To-Do List App</h1>

This is a simple To-Do List web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made this project to practice JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage. This app helps users add, complete, and delete daily tasks easily.

In this project, users can type a task in the input box and click the Add button to add it to the list. When a task is clicked, it gets marked as completed. Users can also delete any task by clicking the cross icon next to it. The tasks are saved using localStorage, so they do not disappear after refreshing the page.

HTML is used to create the structure of the app, CSS is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript is used to handle all the logic like adding tasks, deleting tasks, marking tasks as done, and saving data in the browser. This project helped me understand how JavaScript works with HTML elements.

This To-Do List App is created for learning and practice purposes as part of my BCA coursework and to improve my front-end development skills.
